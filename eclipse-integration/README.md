These projects can be used to compile and produce an update site
that will enable integrations with the RTC docker images. One
feature allows you to push new/changed plugins with an update
site project via the server patcher port on the container. Another
one allows you to pick individual Java classes to hot swap them
into the running server. Check for the Docker context menu for
more options.
